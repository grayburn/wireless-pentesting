### Wireless Reconnaissance

This is the first stage for beginning your wireless penetration test after defining your scope.

Objectives:
* Observe how far your wireless signal propagates by war-driving the area around your building or buildings
* Enumerate your devices, what can be detected. Perform a wireless scan.
* What type of Encryption and Authentication is being used
* Is there a Guest network available
* What channels are being used
* What AP manufacturer is being used
* What client devices are being used

Tools to used:
* airodump-ng (Part of the Aircrack-ng suite of wireless tools)
* tcpdump-ng
* kismet

Hardware needed:
* Laptop
* Supported wireless adapter
  * TP-Link TL-WN722N
  * Alfa Networks AWUS036NHA
  * Alfa Networks AWUS036H
  * Alfa Networks AWUS051NH
* Embedded system (Raspberry Pi, Odroid C1+, Wifi Pineapple Mark V, Tetra or Nano)

Software Other...
* Kali Linux (2016.1 Rolling) (http://kali.org)
* Pentoo (http://www.pentoo.ch)
* Blackarch (https://blackarch.org)
* VMware - (Fusion or Workstation if going the virtual route)
* Virtualbox (If going the virtual route)

Putting your WLAN adapter into monitor mode:
~~~bash
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlanX (wlanX is your wireless interface)
~~~
Alternative methods for putting your adapter into monitor mode:
~~~bash
ifconfig wlanX down
iw wlanX set type monitor (wlanX is your wireless interface)
ifconfig wlanX up
~~~
~~~bash
ifconfig wlanX down
iwconfig wlanX mode monitor (wlanX is your wireless interface)
ifconfig wlanX up
~~~
Create a new monitor interface from wlanX: (this will create a new interface called mon0 and set it to monitor mode)
~~~bash
ifconfig wlanX down
iw dev wlanX interface add mon0 type monitor
ifconfig mon0 up
~~~
Changing the channel for your wireless interface (Once you have placed the interface into monitor mode)
~~~bash
iwconfig wlanX channel 6 (wlanX is your monitor interface)
~~~
~~~bash
iw dev mon0 set channel 6 (change mon0 to your monitor interface)
~~~
**Troubleshooting adapter issues**
Most issues that arise when trying to put your wireless card into monitor mode are from Network-manager trying to control that interface. You can stop the Network-manager service by issuing the following command: **(Do this before putting your adapter into monitor mode)**
~~~bash
service network-manager stop
~~~
airmon-ng also has a command that can take care of any processes that might interfere with your monitor interface
~~~bash
airmon-ng check kill
~~~
Examples for airodump-ng: (Change wlan0mon to your monitor mode interface)
~~~bash
airodump-ng --band abg --manufacturer --uptime --write capture.pcap wlan0mon
~~~
