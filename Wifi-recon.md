### Wireless Reconnaissance

This is the first stage for beginning your wireless penetration test after defining your scope.

Objectives:
* Observe how far your wireless signal propagates by war-driving the area around your building or buildings
* Enumerate your devices, what can be detected. Perform a wireless scan.
* What type of Encryption and Authentication is being used
* Is there a Guest network available
* What channels are being used
* What AP manufacturer is being used
* What client devices are being used

Tools to used:
* airodump-ng (Part of the Aircrack-ng suite of wireless tools)
* tcpdump-ng
* kismet

Hardware needed:
* Laptop
* Supported wireless adapter
* Embedded system (Raspberry Pi, Odroid C1+, Wifi Pineapple Mark V, Tetra or Nano)

Software Other...
* Kali Linux (2016.1 Rolling) (http://kali.org)
* Pentoo (http://www.pentoo.ch)
* Blackarch (https://blackarch.org)
* VMware - (Fusion or Workstation if going the virtual route)
* Virtualbox (If going the virtual route)

Putting your WLAN adapter into monitor mode:
~~~bash
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng start wlanX (wlanX is your wireless interface)
~~~
Alternative methods for putting your adapter into monitor mode
~~~bash
iw wlanX set type monitor (wlanX is your wireless interface)
~~~
Examples for airodump-ng: (Change wlan0mon to your monitor mode interface)
~~~bash
airodump-ng --band abg --manufacturer --uptime --write capture.pcap wlan0mon
~~~
