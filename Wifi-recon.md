### Wireless Reconnaissance

This is the first stage for beginning your wireless penetration test after defining your scope.

Objectives:
* Observe how far your wireless signal propagates by war-driving the area around your building or buildings
* Enumerate your devices, what can be detected. Perform a wireless scan.
* What type of Encryption and Authentication is being used
* Is there a Guest network available
* What channels are being used
* What AP manufacturer is being used
* What client devices are being used

Tools to used:
* airodump-ng (Part of the Aircrack-ng suite of wireless tools)
* tcpdump-ng
* kismet

Examples: (Change wlan0mon to your monitor mode interface)
~~~bash
airodump-ng --band abg --manufacturer --uptime --write capture.pcap wlan0mon
~~~
